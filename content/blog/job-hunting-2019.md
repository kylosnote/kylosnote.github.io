 So here is the thing. I am a fresh graduate from IT background with a somewhat decent CGPA 3.6+
 I finished my internship August last year and decided not to continue work at that company even though they did offer me a great begining salary to stay.
 

 After internship I took a break and started doing a freelance project which eventually cancelled.


 I begin my job hunt around Dec 2018. So far I applied around 20 job for different job position.


 All of the job I applied I either have keen interest with or I have experience in it.


 I received numerous call from job recruitor too, unfortunately the job they offering are the one I am not interested in.


 I also done 3 face to face interview. The interview will usually begin by asking you to introduce yourself and tell them thing about yourself. So be prepared for this, and memorize some good thing about yourself that you want to tell them.


 After that they will start to ask you about your experience with the technolgy or skillset they required for the job. Be honest with your answer because they are the expert with it so they can tell if you are lying or boasting yourself.


 Sometime they will ask you question like "Where do you see yourself in 5 years". Just answer what came into your mind.


 If you are like me looking for job position include technical stuff, they will give you a test or ask yoo technical thing. So be prepared for this and take your time to answer the question.


 All the interview are around the same in my opinion, so don't be disappointed when you didn't get the job because probably you are just isn't who they looking for.


 Right now I still haven't found a job but I am looking forward to it. Life is harsh for me, a lot of thing need to get done. There is weight on my shoulder I needed some place to realse those tension. That is why I wrote this blog. Whoever you are I hope you enjoy reading my blog. The article is quite messy if you ask me. 


 Until next time.
