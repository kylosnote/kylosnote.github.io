            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Last Day of 2018</h1>
<p>Today is the last day of 2018. A lots of thing happened, some of them were good and some were bad.
I will just write about the most recent event that happened in my life.
.. more::
So around September this year, my friend recomended me to do a freelance project with him. I decided why not, so i partnered up with him to do this freelance project that will last for few months. This project is using Laravel framework and is a CRM system. The guy that hired us are new to this as well. The wage is meh but still considerated as reasonable. So money is not an issue to this just so you know. At the very begining of the project we were very active, weekly meeting and actively communicate with each other. As time passed, I started to realise I am having difficuties to stay motivated for this project. Not only that, because the documentation are poorly prepared I felt less and less pasionnated to continue this project. This goes the same to my partner as well, plus my partner are getting busy for other thing in life as well.
So last night finally, I took the courage to talk with my partner ask if he want to continue this project and express my thought about giving up this project. Obviously my partner felt the same way as well so on our behalf he talked to the project owner about us didnt want to continue the project. Luckily the project owner didnt blame us and he is kinda of understanding as well. So we settled the thing in peace. I will soon hand over the whole project source code to him and he will find someone else to continue the project.
Till this point he paid us about 30% of the project and the project is done like 70% so this is not a bad deal to him. I think this is the reason why he so okay with us abandon the project. Anyway this is not the point. Knowing that I don’t have to continue doing thing that I don’t like and have no passion in it at all I felt relieved like my shoulder just got lighter. Even though I understand that it is my fault in this whole thing but I felt less guilty. Throughout this event, I realised that even though I made mistake but I sure do grow as well. I learnt thing from the outcome of this event. Not everything is suitable for me, I will just have to keep improving myself. Life can be very confusing. Let the time season me in a beter way.
Right now I just hope to have a happy 2019, 2018 has it up and down. In 2019 I just want to work hard, play hard, be happy, be contained. There are many things that I want to try as well. Baby step, one thing at the time.Peace.</p>
